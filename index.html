            <div class="content">
                <p>I am Scott Chenoweth, a current WordPress Apprentice with Alpha Works! My journey into the developer industry started when I was 5 years old and my mother sat me infront of her old
                    Windows 98 computer. I was instantly hooked. I knew from that point on I belonged infront of a computer. I majored in graphic design at first and loved it, and eventually I had to take a computer science class.
                    I hadn't realized when I signed up for that class, that the teacher I selected so happened to be head of the computer science department, and she set her expectations high for her intro class.
                    Most of the introductory classes were teaching Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, and how to create folders in Windows. Of course my class started out the same way, and it bored me so much
                    because I had learned most of this by the time I was in 3rd grade! Once we got past the kiddie stuff, our professor decided to introduce us to the world of programming. I loved every bit of it, and from then on,
                     it was always in the back of my mind. I didn't think computer science was an option for me, considering I lived in Fresno, CA and there wasn't many 
                    tech opportunities, and I wasn't willing to give up my family. I went to Fresno State and majored in Speech Language Pathology, and it was a huge mistake for me! I hated it so much, but the 
                    opportunities in my area belonged to the health field, so that's where I stayed. I never got to finish my degree, and started working in the health field as an in-home care provider, up until the pandemic
                    hit. One day, I spotted the BitWise buildings off the 41 freeway in Downtown Fresno and wondered what they were. So, I looked into it and saw that they are this amazing tech opportunity sitting right infront of me.
                    I wasted no time and joined in on one of their tacobout events where they share what they're all about, and I aligned with EVERYTHING that BitWise is about, and instantly signed up for their
                    Websites For Beginners class. I loved every moment of it and decided that this opportunity right in front of me needed to be taken. I learned so much in such a short amount of time and I showed great interest in 
                    their apprenticeship program, and before I could finish my second class, I was offered to be apart of their WordPress Apprenticeship. Of course I accepted, and here I am now, continuing my BitWise journey, looking 
                    forward to more growth and even more opportunity!

            <p>Through my BitWise Journey I've taken two of their fantastic classes, Websites for Beginners and Mobile Friendly, and for each of them I had to create a personal portfolio website.
                Listed below are my two final projects from those classes!
